# School District Analysis

## Overview of the School District Analysis

### Purpose

The school board has notified the analytics team (Maria and her supervisor) that the students_complete.csv file shows evidence of academic dishonesty; specifically, reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders appear to have been altered. Although the school board does not know the full extent of the academic dishonesty, they want to uphold state-testing standards and have asked for help. 


### Methodology

The analysis was conducted using Jupyter notebook with pandas and numpy python language tools.

To determine the impact that the suspected fraud at Thomas High School (THS) has had on the overall performance of the school, a new dataframe was created in which the math and reading scores for THS ninth grade were replaced with null values,  NaNs, while keeping the rest of the data intact.

To determine the impact of the changes a new school district analysis was run with the null values and compared to the original analysis.

A comparison was then done between the original school district analysis and the new school district analysis.


## Results

The results of the comparison between the original an new school district analyses follow.
